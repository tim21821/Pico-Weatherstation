# Pico Weatherstation

This is just a little hobby project about building an indoor 
weatherstation with a Raspberry Pi Pico, a LCD display and - in the 
future - a temperature/humidity sensor.

## Components

To build the station you need

* a [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/),
* a [Waveshare Pico-LCD-2](https://www.waveshare.com/pico-lcd-2.htm),
* a Micro USB power supply.

## Installation

If you want to use the code yourself, you can download it by typing 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tim21821/Pico-Weatherstation.git
``` 
to the terminal. Then copy the main.py, display.py, draw.py and temperature.py files 
to your Pico.

Alternatively you can download the code as a zip-Archive, unzip it and
copy the mentioned files to your Pico.

You can find a tutorial on how to prepare your Pico for use of 
Micropython and how to copy the source files using Thonny 
[here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico/0).
